#Website project for a pet shop with pages for dogs, cats, prices, and offers, as well as a contact page with a form and information for product delivery. The Figma tool was used for prototyping, resulting in a consistent, sober, and homogeneous design and layout. It allowed me to develop the project from start to finish, including design and front-end development.
